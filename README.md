HEART RATE MONITORING (UR LUB-DUB)

This project involves creating a heart rate detection device using an ESP32 microcontroller. The device integrates a pulse heart sensor for real-time heart rate measurement, an OLED display for visual feedback, and a buzzer for alerts. A button is included for user interaction, allowing actions such as starting or stopping the monitoring process.

The heart rate data is accessible through a local web server, enabling users to monitor their heart rate remotely via a web interface. Additionally, the web server provides the option to download the recorded heart rate data for further analysis or record-keeping purposes. This project showcases the integration of IoT and embedded systems in health monitoring applications.
